# Get game deals from some of the biggest sellers

This app can be used by anyone that enjoys playing games on PC and getting them for the best price. It uses the CheapShark API to do most of the outsourcing
but I decided to take a new approach to the design and moving forward I believe there is potential to make a very appealing website for all gamers to enjoy.

## Current uses

Over the last 5 days I have given the site a news greeting with the carousel to see some of the hottest games/deals right now and what people are saying about them.
It lets the user know whether the game may be the right choice for them or if they wanna keep an eye on it in case it is available for a good deal.

I have also gottten several uses of the API already working. I set up the store navbar to show only the stores that are currently active in the api. If they are not active then the code sweeps them out and saves room for the rest of the stores that are active. I have gotten all deals from each store and able for the user to sort through each store and view all the deals going on. I have also setup to where they can view the Metacritic score and steam reviews in case they want to see the current trend of what people are saying about the game they are looking at. Lastly I displayed the retail price and the current deal price for the user to see.

## Future Advancements

My next steps I wanna make towards this app are shorting the page length by setting up pages for the user to sort through and not feel like they are scrolling forever through the page. That would be next step. After that I would start setting up sorting options for the user to sort through the deals and even games they are looking for. First setting up the pricing options which would really help with how big the user's wallet is feeling. Then being able to search for a particular game would really cut down on the users time searching for a particular game.
